A Python script which extracts facial movement features in real-time by analizing the video stream of a webcam. It's part of the [NithSensors](https://github.com/LIMUNIMI/NITHsensors) collection, and it's built to be used for interaction purposes.

The currently extracted facial movement features are:
- Head rotation (yaw and pitch)
- Opening of the left and right eyes
- Mouth opening

Detected features are relayed locally over IP "127.0.0.1" on UDP port 20100, using the standard NithSensors communication protocol (see NithSensors [Readme](https://github.com/LIMUNIMI/NITHsensors)) This allows applications designed to work with NithSensors to receive and incorporate these detections.

Landmarks extraction is provided by the [MediaPipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/) library.

## Installation Guide

### Step 1: Installing Python

NithFC is built with Python, meaning you'll need Python installed on your computer to run it. If you're new to Python, follow this steps:

1. Visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Download the latest version of Python for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
3. Run the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions. Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python X.X to PATH" during installation to make Python accessible from your command line or terminal.

For a more detailed guide, you can check out this beginner-friendly [Python installation tutorial](https://realpython.com/installing-python/).

### Step 2: Download NithFC

You can download NithFC by cloning the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LIMUNIMI/NithFC.git
```

### Step 3: Installing Dependencies

With Python installed, open your command line or terminal and install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy mediapipe python-osc
```

These dependencies include packages for computer vision operations, mathematics, data handling, extracting facial landmarks, and sending data over UDP.

## Running NithFC
To run NithFC, ensure you're in the NithFC directory in your command line or terminal. Then execute:

```bash
python main.py
```

Make sure your webcam is connected and properly setup as NithFC will immediately begin to capture and analyze facial movements.

Thanks to one of my thesis students ([@Ale-Gr](https://github.com/Ale-Gr/)), which contributed to this project with his thesis work. üôè Check out [his code](https://github.com/LIMUNIMI/TT-Alessandro_Grasso-2024-975295), which is a similar application which sends a similar set of features formatted using the OSC (Open Sound Control) protocol, provides a graphical user interface, a calibration system, and can be used to emulate the mouse cursor (for accessibility purposes).

The head rotation analysis function is based on a Python script provided by [Nicolai Nielsen in a tutorial on YouTube](https://youtu.be/-toNMaS4SeQ?si=gcpJSJcbziH-V4DN). Thank you üôè
